    </p>
    <p>
        A favorite spin on a traditional flat bread from India. Normally baked
        inside hot Tandoor ovens with charcoal or wood fire, our naan bread recipe
        has been altered to cook them right on the stove in a hot cast-iron
        skillet. We use a combination of yogurt and oil to give them an addictive
        soft and fluffy texture, and add minced garlic right into the dough to
        give us a perfect garlicky flavor. You'll be amazed watching them puff up
        into glorious breads right in front of you in seconds!

    <h3 id="instructions">Instructions:</h3>
    <h5>For Naan Bread</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine together the water, sugar and yeast. Let sit for 5-10 minutes or until the mixture begins to bubble
            on top</li>
        <li>Add in the milk, yogurt, oil, minced garlic, flour baking powder and salt. Mix until the dough comes
            together with your hands.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Use floured hands to knead the dough until smooth, about 3 to 5
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease the same mixing bowl with a small spray of cooking oil. Transfer dough to the bowl and cover
            with plastic wrap. Let rest at room temperature for about an hour until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, divide the dough into 10 equal pieces. Roll into balls, then use a rolling pin to roll
            each piece of dough into a large oval, about 6-inches long and 1/8-inch thick. Repeat with remaining dough.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Grease skillet all over with 1/2 teaspoon of the extra
            oil.</li>
        <li>Place one piece of the naan on the oiled hot skillet and cook until bubbles form on top, about 1-2 minutes.
            While cooking, brush the top with a little oil.</li>
        <li>Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until large golden spots appear on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Remove from the skillet and wrap in a clean kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining naan (keep them wrapped
            in a towel while you work).</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>For Garlic Butter Topping</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine melted butter and minced garlic together in a bowl. Brush each naan with the garlic butter and top
            with the fresh herb of your choosing.</li>
    </ol>
